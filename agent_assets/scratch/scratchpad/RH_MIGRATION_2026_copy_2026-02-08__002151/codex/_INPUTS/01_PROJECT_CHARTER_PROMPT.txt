RH_MIGRATION_2026 — MASTER PROJECT CHARTER (PORTFOLIO + BASELINE + GOVERNANCE)

SCOPE + INTENT (READ THIS AS BINDING)
This project is not a “cute GitHub project.” The goal is to demonstrate that I can run a controlled migration + automation program with operations discipline.

Core purpose: build a mini change-management system with:
- Phase-gated work (DryRun → Execute → Verify)
- Provenance preservation (trash policy, manifests, no delete)
- Rollback artifacts for risky ops (e.g., registry changes)
- Deterministic structure (phase folders + predictable paths)
- Audit trail (timestamped run folders, diffs, manifests)

Non-negotiable: Proof pack outputs must ship.
A clean folder hierarchy without evidence is failure.

PROJECT ROOTS (AUTHORITATIVE)
PROJECT ROOT (ROOT):
C:\RH\OPS\SYSTEM\migrations\RH_MIGRATION_2026\

CANONICAL SYSTEM ROOT (CANONICAL):
C:\RH\

HARD EXCLUSION (never touch, never enumerate unless I explicitly instruct it):
C:\RH\VAULT_NEVER_SYNC\

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FILES (READ FIRST, EVERY SESSION)
Read and bind to these files before doing anything else:
- ROOT\codex\refrence.txt
- ROOT\codex\engine_run.txt
- ROOT\codex\Codex_Context_02-07-2026.txt
- ROOT\codex\MASTER_AGENT_FULL_PLAN_02-07-2026.txt
- ROOT\codex\PHASE_STATUS.md
- ROOT\codex\BASELINE_DECLARATION_02-07-2026.md
- ROOT\codex\BASELINE_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md

If any conflicts exist among these files or with this charter:
- STOP
- Quote the conflicting lines
- Propose the smallest possible resolution
- Do not guess, do not silently “standardize”

CANONICAL DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (DO NOT DEVIATE)
ROOT must contain ONLY:
- phase_01\
- phase_02\
- phase_03\
- phase_04\
- phase_05\
- phase_06\
- phase_07\
- phase_08\
- phase_09\
- phase_10\
- phase_11\
- codex\
- trash\

Each phase_XX must contain at minimum:
- scripts\
- runs\
- docs\
- artifacts\
Optional, only when needed:
- research\
- legacy_engine\
- patch_backups\

Baseline/legacy “engine” or “runs” concepts are NOT top-level canonical.
If legacy engine/runs exist, they are historical evidence and must remain either:
- in trash provenance, or
- phase-scoped legacy_* folders

FILENAME STANDARD (GLOBAL)
All created files must follow:
name_MM-DD-YYYY.ext  (name first, date last)
If timestamp required:
name_MM-DD-YYYY__HHMMSS.ext
No ISO dates. No date-first filenames.

EXECUTION GOVERNANCE (GLOBAL)
Default operating mode is DRY RUN.
- In DRY RUN: do not execute scripts; do not run system-modifying commands.
- Only execute when I explicitly say: “EXECUTE <phase/task>”
- If a command would change files/registry/system state and I did not explicitly authorize execution, STOP.

NO DELETE (GLOBAL, ABSOLUTE)
Deletion is forbidden.
- Never call delete/remove operations (e.g., Remove-Item).
- If something must be removed from active locations:
  MOVE it into project trash with timestamp.
- Trash destination must be under:
  ROOT\trash\<category>\<MM-DD-YYYY__HHMMSS>\...

TRASH + DUPLICATE POLICY (DETERMINISTIC)
- Never overwrite existing files.
- If destination exists, append deterministic suffix:
  (dupe-0001), (dupe-0002), etc.
- Always produce a manifest CSV for any move/copy batch:
  source_path, dest_path, reason, timestamp, hash(optional)

BASELINE GOVERNANCE (PAUSE CORRECTLY, DO NOT REWRITE HISTORY)
Baseline is historical truth, including wrong turns, refactors, and outdated models.
- Do not “clean up” baseline artifacts retroactively.
- Do not rewrite baseline docs to make them “look clean.”
- All corrections must be additive via addenda that link to baseline evidence.

If baseline anchor files are missing:
- Create them at EXACT paths using exact template text I provide (verbatim, no paraphrase).
- Do not reorganize baseline artifacts as part of creating baseline anchors.

PHASE STATUS GOVERNANCE (NO INFERENCE)
Phase completion is authoritative ONLY from:
ROOT\codex\PHASE_STATUS.md

Rules:
- Do not infer completion from prose, logs, or “seems done.”
- If PHASE_STATUS conflicts with observed evidence:
  STOP and report the conflict. Do not “fix” silently.
- Allowed phase states (use these exact labels):
  - NOT STARTED
  - IN PROGRESS
  - COMPLETE_PENDING_PROOF
  - COMPLETE
  - COMPLETE (CLOSED)

Retrospective proof is permitted:
- If a phase was executed earlier but lacks PURPOSE/PROOF docs, mark:
  COMPLETE_PENDING_PROOF
until the required deliverables exist.

PER-PHASE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS (APPLIES TO PHASES 01–11)
A phase is NOT COMPLETE unless it has ALL THREE:

1) One-page story (docs)
   Must exist at:
   ROOT\phase_XX\docs\PHASE_XX_PURPOSE.md
   Must include:
   - What problem Phase XX solved
   - What could have gone wrong
   - What changed
   - How it was verified
   - How to roll it back (if applicable)
   - Links to the specific run folders / manifests used

2) Proof artifact (artifacts)
   Must exist at:
   ROOT\phase_XX\artifacts\PHASE_XX_PROOF.md
   Must reference concrete evidence:
   - run folder paths (exact)
   - logs (exact filenames)
   - manifests (plan.csv/results.csv/diff.md, etc.)
   - screenshots/snippets if applicable (paths)
   - rollback artifact locations (paths)

3) Runnable component (scripts)
   Must exist under:
   ROOT\phase_XX\scripts\
   Minimum acceptable:
   - verify-only script OR
   - dry-run generator OR
   - inventory baseline generator
   A phase is not “done” without a runnable component, even if it only verifies.

PROOF PACK PIPELINE (PHASE 09-ISH, START EARLY)
Maintain a proof-pack pipeline at:
C:\RH\OPS\PROOF_PACKS\RH_MIGRATION_2026\

Default behavior:
- Create skeleton only unless explicitly instructed to copy artifacts.
- Do not bulk-dump files into the proof pack.

Proof pack must include:
- README.md (what this project is, why it matters)
- PHASE_SUMMARY.md (phase status table + links)
- EVIDENCE\phase_XX\ (key screenshots/snippets/log excerpts)
- SCRIPTS\ (sanitized copies)
- TIMELINE.md (what happened when, with run IDs and paths)

Sanitization rule:
- Never include secrets/tokens/credentials.
- Avoid personal identifiers when possible.
- If uncertain, STOP and ask rather than copying raw data.

REALITY CHECK (ROI)
The goal is NOT to fill every phase folder with busywork.
The goal is to ship 3–5 phases with undeniable evidence + clean packaging.
Phase 4 + Phase 6 + Phase 7 (+ maybe Phase 3 inventory) is already portfolio-grade even if later phases remain planned.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIREMENT (RESPOND IN THIS FORMAT, THEN STOP)
After reading the source-of-truth files, acknowledge by outputting:

A) Baseline:
- Baseline cutoff date and meaning
- Confirmation baseline artifacts will not be rewritten

B) Governance:
- Confirm no-delete + trash-only + deterministic dupe handling
- Confirm DryRun default + explicit EXECUTE requirement
- Confirm PHASE_STATUS is authoritative (no inference)

C) Portfolio/Proof:
- Confirm the 3 required deliverables per phase
- Confirm proof-pack pipeline behavior (skeleton-only unless authorized)

D) Current Status Snapshot (from PHASE_STATUS.md only):
- List phases as COMPLETE / COMPLETE_PENDING_PROOF / IN PROGRESS / NOT STARTED
- Identify the next allowed work items without executing anything

Then STOP. Do not take any action.
